            <h2>2. Hack Squat</h2>

                <p>
                    The hack squat is a different variation of the squat, but the principles are the same. The main difference is
                    that it is a machine and not free weight. This means there is less risk of injury and accidents.

            <div class="introparagraph">
                <p>
                    The leg press is a great exercise for those who are not comfortable enough
                    to perform squats, as it keeps you firmly in place and you only use your legs to move
                    the weight. Simply use your legs to push the weight up and then bend your knees to lower it towards you.
